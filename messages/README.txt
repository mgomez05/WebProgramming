README for Messages part 2
------------------

For this assignment, I made a website which sends an XmlHTTPRequest upon loading in order to receive json messaging data. The message was then parsed and displayed on the page in the inner html of the messages div. I also used some CSS styling to make things more interesting.

Correctly Implemented Aspects
-------------------------------
As requested in the assignment, I downloaded the messages.zip file, expanded it, and modified the lab.js file to open the file using an XHR request, parse the JSON data, and output the messages in the messages section of the HTML. I did not modify the HTML file and did not use jQuery. I also took the liberty of modifying the CSS file to style the messages a bit more.

Lab 5: Responsive Design
------------------------

For this assignment, I created a web page that displays different panels of the software.png file depending on the width of the viewing screen. Starting from a width greater than 1200 pixels and then decreasing in width, the page displays the panels of software.png going from left to right, and then jumping to the first panel in the next row after the last panel in the first row has been displayed.

--Aspects of the Work That Have Been Correctly Implemented--
This webpage correctly changes the image displayed in software.png using responsive.css, as per the spec for Lab 5 of Comp 20. I have copied the html provided on the spec exactly as it appeared into an index.html and have not modified it. All three files--responsive.css, index.html, and software.png--can be found in the responsive folder as requested, and the responsive folder can be found in the private Github repo that Ming Chow created for me.

--Collaboration or Discussions With Other People--
None, though I consulted the sources provided on canvas and on the spec sheet.

--Time Spent On Assignment--
2-3 hours

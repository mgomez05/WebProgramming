README for Comp 20 Lab 13 Security and Privacy Assessment of a Web Application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment, I performed a security assessment of a potentially vulnerable 
web application. After using command line tools such as curl, reading over the source code
provided, and testing out different vulnerabilities with black box and white box testing
using both the online version of the web application and a locally run version, I came
to several conclusions about the app and recorded them in a file named index.html. The file
contains descriptions of the app, the methodology for my testing, an abstract of my findings,
a list of issues for the app (complete with the location, severity, proof, and resolution for each one), and a conclusion.

---------Correctly Implemented Aspects--------
I have correctly implemented all aspects of the assignment. I tested the web application for
vulnerabilities, have provided an index.html
page complete with the requirements listed in the specification, and the page contains at least
3 vulnerabilities present within the web application. I have also provided a README for the assignment.

----------Collaboration Notes----------
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

----------Time Spent-----------------
I spent 6 hours on this assignment, with much time spent styling the index.html page
to make it pleasant to look at, and looking for the correct syntax to use the $ne operator
to make the server dump its database contents.

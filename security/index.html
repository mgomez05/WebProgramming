<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First tried typing characters that commonly cause issues in input forms ($, \, angle brackets, ", ', ?, !) </li>
    <li>Tried writing a script, but the input field didn't allow enough spaces to write starting and ending brackets</li>
    <li>Tried leaving different fields blank
        (Didn't seem to do much)</li>
    <li>Tried non-numerical values in login field, and text values in latitude and longitude field</li>
    <li>Tried very large numerical inputs for latitude and longitude</li>
    <li>Tried negative numbers in the input field</li>
    <li>Tried different query parameters for the submit page</li>
    <li>Pressed submit button multiple times</li>
    <li>Pressed reset button multiple times</li>
    <li>logged in with the username "abc" and tried adding scripts to latitude and longitude</li>
    <li>Opened up the source and looked for vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Tried a mongodb query using the $ne operator and got an http 505 error in response that says http version not supported</li>
    <li>Tried finding a place to put a script tag and found it using the curl</li>
<!-- curl -d "lat=23&lng=27&login=<script>alert(\"hello\")</script>" -X POST https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/submit-->
</ul>
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you type a number larger than 400, the app crashes and you come to a submit page with an error message
        (I entered hello, 444, and login and it crashed it) (I later realized this was because there
         was an if statement checking if lat was between -90 and 90 and lng was between -180 and 180
        but, that there was no else, and so server never sent back a response)</li>
        <li>Says something went terribly wrong when hitting submit with all fields empty</li>
        <li>The page does not display any data on the home page</li>
        <li>When entering non-numerical characters into lat and longitude fields, it says something went terribly wrong</li>
        <li>I did a post to the submit path with the body parameters lat, lng, and login and was
            able to succesfully login as a new user
        </li>
    </ul>

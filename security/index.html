<h1>Security Assessment of the Jordan-Marsh Web Application</h1>
<p class="authorNote">Prepared by Russ Gomez â€¢ 6/30/18</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="indent">This assessment tests the security of the Jordan-Marsh web application developed by Ming Chow for Lab 13 of the Comp 20 Web Programming Course (<a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/">https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</a>). From what
    I've gathered while testing it, Jordan-Marsh is a fairly straightforward web application--on a login page, it allows
    users to sign in with their latitude and longitude, and then prompts then to go to the home page, where a list of recent
    logins, complete with name, latitude, and longitude, and time, can be found. However, in spite of this simple design,
    a series of vulnerabilities in the application
    currently make it unsuitable for public use. This document identifies those vulnerabilities and suggests solutions for
    them.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p class="indent">Testing was first carried out "black-box", using only what would be available to an attacker. I tested several different
    inputs in the input field on the login page located at the path '/entry.html', then tried creating urls with potentially dangerous query
    parameters. Some of the different inputs included characters that commonly
    causes issues in input forms, such as $, \, angle brackets, ", ', ?, !, as well as html script tags with javascript inside of them (however, this last attempt was unsuccessful due to a character limit in the input field). I also tried leaving different fields blank, typing in non-numerical values for the
    login field, using text chars for the latitude and longitude fields, and using very large or negative numbers for the latitude
    and longitude fields. I also tried guessing different query parameters for the 'entry.html' page with a post command, and pressing the submit and reset
    button multiple times.
</p>
<p class="indent">I then moved over to white box testing, analyzing the source code for the server and its dependencies (server-vuln.js and
    package.json respectively) supplied on the assignment website, and using my insights to perform informed testing. Somes
    of these informed tests were carried out using a local version of the server, with a local mongodb database and local
    heroku instance, and making requests with curl or in address bar of my browser. I would often modify the local version
    of the server and test it to see how the behavior changed, adding console.log() statements and changing "if statements",
    and then testing the local server. Other times I would test the real server located at https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/.
    All these whitebox tests used information about the different paths and parameters for the application, which I discovered
    by analyzing the source code. In particular, my tests centered on attempting cross site scripting, revealing hidden contents
    of the mongodb database, and making users revovled around trying to
</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p class="indent">As with most security issues, many vulnerabilities in the Jordan-Marsh application result from a lack of santitation and
    validation of user input. Multiple vulnerabilities let an attacker manipulate the website by submitting javascript or
    mongodb commands as query parameters in urls (such as the login parameter). There are also several inputs which cause
    the website to hang and ultimately crash since the server assumes valid inputs will be provided for certain fields, such
    as the latitude and longitude. The website also allows for cross origin access which allows other sources to directly
    post information to the website and in turn the database, manipulating them both in dangerous ways.
</p>
<p>NOTE: While many inputs prompt the message "Whoops, something went terribly wrong with
    your data entry.", these messages are anticipated by the server and don't actually crash it. This can lead to many false
    positives during black box testing, as the tester may assume these messages are only printed in very extreme cases (when
    in fact they can be quite common ones).
</p>
<h2>Issues Found</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Injection of Addtional Database Information</h3>
        <p>Users are able to make new locations whenever they want by making direct posts to the web application. I came to this conclusion almost
            entirely through analyzing the source code, as I had no idea the '/sendLocation' path (the route where a new location can be made)
            even existed when performing only black box tests. But after coming to the conclusion, I tested out the theory by making a post
        to the '/sendLocation' path with the body parameters lat, lng, and login and was able to succesfully create
            a new location.</p> <!--(i.e.
            <code>curl -d "lat=23&amplng=27&amplogin=newUser" -X POST https: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code>).-->
            
            <div class="screenshotDiv">
                <h4>Sample Database Injection</h4>

            </div>
            <div class="screenshotDiv">
                <h4>Sample Database Injection Server Response</h4>

            </div>
            
        
        <p>Overall, this issue has a high severity--it allows the user to bypass the normal flow of the application by skipping the normal process for making
           a location (by providing valid input at the 'entry.html' page), and potentially perform cross site scripting (see the "Cross Site Scripting" section for more details).
           Beyond that, it could also overwhelm the server by using up its database memory--it's possible that the server
           might want to limit the database's contents at some point, but if it can't control when that information is sent, and is therefore unable to limit it,
           it may become overwhelmed. 
  
        </p>
        <p class="resolution">This issue can be resolved by requiring some sort of authentication before accepting the POST request, such as a CSRF token,
            or by santizing post parameters.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Application Error on Invalid Latitude or Longitude</h3>
        
        <p>After performing a number of black box tests in the input fields on the 'entry.html' page, I came to the conclusion that certain latitudes and longitudes prompt
           a strange application error. Specifically, when you type a latitude outside the range [-90,90] or a longitude
        outside the range [-180, 180] the app waits a while and then a page from heroku will come up informing you that an
        error occured in the application. This results from the fact that in the server code (server-vuln.js), there is an if statement checking
        if the latitude parameter (lat) is between -90 and 90 and the longitude parameter (lng) is between -180 and 180, but there is no "else statement"--the function for handling
        the post simply ends--so the server never sends back a response and the client is left waiting. </p>
        <div class="screenshotDiv">
            <h4>Input for Application Error:</h4>
            <img src="./InputForApplicationErrorJordan-Marsh.png" alt="Input for Application Error">
        </div>
        <div class="screenshotDiv">
            <h4>Resulting Application Error:</h4>
            <img src="./ApplicationErrorJordan-Marsh.png" alt="Application Error" style="width: 70%; height:70%;">
        </div>

        <p>Overall, this issue has a fairly moderate severity, for while it is inconvenient and unsettling to the user experience, it is
            caught by the heroku framework and does not crash the server. If the user simply hits the back button or refreshes,
            the error vanishes. However, if this is done several times, it could conceivably use up server resources.
        </p>

        <p class="resolution">
            This issue can be resolved if the server handles the "else" case for the "if statement" and sends a response to the user
            saying that the input wasn't valid.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Viewing of Database Contents</h3>
        <p>Any user can dump the contents of the mongodb database (or at least a lot of its "locations" collection) that's attached to the server by putting
            in the $ne operator in one of the query parameters for the '/checkins.json' path. I remembered a very similar example
            presented in one of Ming Chow's lectures on the subject of database vulnerabilities, and so made an effort
            to find such a vulnerability in the server source code. In a similar spirit to his demonstrations, the example below prompts the server to returned
            all documents in
            the locations collection where the login field is not equal to "mchowasdglkj". As one might imagine, this effectively returns almost
            any document in the database's "locations" collection with a "login" attribute. <!--(i.e. put
            <code>https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=russ</code>).-->
        </p>
        <div class="screenshotDiv">
            <h4>Mongo DB Dumps Content:</h4>
            <img src="./mongoDBDumpJordan-Marsh.png" alt="Mongo DB Reveals Content" style="width: 70%; height:70%;">
        </div>
        <p>Overall, this issue has a moderate severity, because it allows users to view large amounts of the contents of the
            database, which could become an important privacy issue if sensitive information was stored in the database.
            As of now, the information stored seems relatively arbitrary (a user can enter any login and any latitude and
            longitude already), so this isn't a high risk, but it could become one if the web application starts storing
            sensitive information. 
        </p>
        <p class="resolution">This issue can be resolved by santizing GET parameters by escaping dangerous characters.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
        <p>Although you can't type a full script into the input field for 'login' at '/entry.html' (there's a limit on the number
            chars that can be typed into the input fields) you can input javascript into the database that will be returned
            at the home page by using query parameters at the '/submit' path (specifically, lat, lng, and login). While black box testing, 
            I had
            a feeling that such a vulnerability might exist, but I wasn't sure exactly where the web page was posting the 
            login request, so I didn't know which url to pass the query parameters to. However, after analyzing the source code,
            I quickly came that the vulnerability was in fact present, and that it came from a lack of input validation. 
            For while the
            server checks that the query parameters lat and lng are float values, there are no checks in place for the login parameter, other than a check for
            a null value, so a user can make the server innocently store "login" strings with malicious javascript into its database. And then later, when listing the contents of its database on the home page, it will write down the 
            script when trying to write a log of concatenated strings, because it retrieves the dangerous login string without santizing it: </p>
            <p><code>indexPage += "&lt;li&gt;" + results[count].login + " checked in at " + results[count].lat + ", " + results[count].lng ... "&lt;/li&gt;";</code></p>
            <p>Knowing all this, I was able to get a simple "hello" alert to appear on the home page after running the following
            command with curl:</p>
            <div class="screenshotDiv">
                <h4>Sample Cross Site Scripting Curl Command</h4>
                <img src="./CrossSiteScriptingCurlCommandJordan-Marsh.png" alt="XSS Sample Curl Command" style="width: 80%; height:80%;">
            </div>
            <!--curl -d "lat=23&amplng=27&amplogin=&ltscript&gtalert(\"hello\")&lt/script&gt" -X POST https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/submit-->
            <div class="screenshotDiv">
                <h4>Sample Cross Site Scripting Alert</h4>
                <img src="./CrossSiteScriptingAlertJordan-Marsh.png" alt="XSS Hello Alert" style="width: 80%; height:80%;">
            </div>
        <p>Overall this issue has a high severity, as it can be exploited to make the home page for a viewer practically useless
            and unviewable--a simple while loop with alerts for example could prevent the user from ever viewing the expected contents
            for the page. A malicious script could also access cookies, session storage data, or search history if desired,
            which presents a privacy issue as well. With javascript there are many creative possibilities for malicious behavior,
            and this vulnerability leaves the website open to many of them.
        </p>
        <p class="resolution">This issue can be resolved by santiziing the post parameters for the '/submit' path, particularly by escaping the
            angle bracket characters.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class="indent">Issues with the Jordan-Marsh application can make its website unreliable, inconvenient, or in extreme cases, unusable. However,
    with simple techniques such as sanitizing and validating input, and handling different cases of user input, this web
    application can become much less vulnerable to attacks. That being said, the website itself still allows for any user
    to view recent logins and post data to it, which poses an issue of trust between the client and the application--how
    can the user trust any data on the website if anyone can add to its database without any strong restrictions? Further,
    how can any user trust that their data is safe if anyone can view the homepage with everyone's login information? In
    order to resolve these overarching issues, there needs to be a more involved authentication process for users who want
    to view and interact with the web application, otherwise the information can never be trusted as valid or safe in terms
    of privacy.

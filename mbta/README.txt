README for Lab 8 MBTA Map
--------------------------

For this assignment, I created an index.html page which displays a map with markers for MBTA lines and color-correspodent paths for each MBTA line represented. As of now, it displays the red, orange, and blue lines, along with the Fairmount commuter rail line.

Correctly Implemented Aspects
------------------------------
I have correctly implemented all aspects of the lab--my map takes up the entire page with a center at South station, the markers I use are customized train markers (not google default markers), I have rendered a red polyline connecting all red line stations (while taking into account the fork at JFK/UMass), and I have used a separate file for the javascript (except for the script tag to include the javascript file.

I have also implemented parts of the Going Beyond section, creating markers and polylines for the orange and blue lines with the appropriate colors. I have done the same for one of the commuter rail lines--the Fairmount line.

Collaboration Notes
--------------------
I have not collaborated or discussed this assignment with anyone else.

Time Spent
-----------
The assignment took me roughly 6 hours (with much time spent looking for coordinates of non-redline stations).

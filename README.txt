Introduction
----------------------
This repository is a collection of different assignments I worked on while
enrolled in the course Comp 20: Web Programming at Tufts University
during the Summer of 2018.

Concepts Learned 
----------------------
I learned a lot from this course, including the many advantages (and disadvantages) of javascript, the way in which way
servers, web pages, databases, and APIs all interact with each other,
and the fundamentals of the version control system git. Consequently, I 
gained much more confidence in creating web programs, writing servers,
and tackling web-based projects.

Favorite Assignment
----------------------
By far my favorite assignment is mbta--an assignment which explores
using the Google Maps API to represent the subway stations of the
Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. Aside from the fun of building
a more involved web application from scratch, it gave me a solid foundation
in working with third party APIs, writing server side code, 
and using javascript to create a dynamic user experience.

Important Takeaways
----------------------
I think the most important thing that I learned from the course
is the flexibility of web development--there are many softwares out
there for creating web content, and many different ways of tackling
the same web project. But with all these tools comes a price--
some have different eases of use (some have better documentation than others, or
just better services), some have different financial investments, 
and some have different security risks. Overall, the web's flexible and 
expansive nature is what makes it so powerful, and but also vulnerable--many people
are working towards improving other people's experiences on the web, 
but there are also those who seek to take advantage of other users.

Next Steps
----------------------
After being newly introduced to server-side programming and
databases, I think those would be the areas I would be most interested in exploring--with tools such as Node.js and MongoDB readily available, these areas seem key
to making larger, more interactive, and more interesting web applications. 
The course has also made me much more interested in web security, as after
our last assignment--appropriately named "security"--it's become clear to me
just how easy it is to write hackable web software. 

Special Thanks 
----------------------
Special thanks to Professor Ming Chow for his enthusiasm, guidance, 
and hard work in making this course a wonderful experience.
